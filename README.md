Title: 
Visualisation Tool for Rendering 3D Polygonal Models

Annotation: 
The goal is to implement modern visualisation tool in C++ language with the use of OpenGL library for rendering.

Aim:
A goal of the thesis is to design and implement visualisation tool for rendering 3D polygonal objects. The tool should provide visualisation options to access different stages of the rendering pipeline, such as wireframe model, input albedo, lightnig result etc. The code should follow principles of modern programming. Implementation will be in C++ programming language using OpenGL rendering library using GLSL shader language.
